# SPL tool (VisionFive2)

Port of the C implementation of StarFive's [`spl_tool`](https://github.com/starfive-tech/Tools/tree/master/spl_tool), which is originally written by [`strlcat`](https://github.com/strlcat).

**WARNING** This tool is in the very earliest stages of development. It still requires a test suite, fuzzing harnesses for file formats, and real-world testing.

## License

`spl_tool` Rust is licensed under the same GPLv2+ license as the original C implementation.
